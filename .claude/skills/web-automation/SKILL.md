# Web Automation

## Overview

This skill enables automated web browser interactions using Playwright MCP tools. It orchestrates complex multi-step browser workflows with **automatic Google OAuth login** support. The browser uses persistent sessions to maintain login state, enabling seamless authentication for Google-based services. For non-Google authentication, it gracefully handles scenarios requiring user intervention (authentication, CAPTCHA, 2FA).

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users request:

- **API key/token generation**: "Generate an API key from Google Cloud Vertex AI"
- **Form submission**: "Fill out this registration form with my details"
- **Data extraction**: "Extract the pricing table from this website"
- **Account configuration**: "Change my notification settings on this service"
- **Multi-step workflows**: "Navigate to X, then do Y, then retrieve Z"

Trigger keywords: web automation, browser, navigate to, API key, fill form, extract from website, scrape, login to

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the User's Goal

Parse the user request to identify:

1. **Target website/URL** (if provided)
2. **Desired outcome** (API key, form submission, data extraction, etc.)
3. **Credentials/inputs needed** (ask user if not provided)
4. **Steps requiring user intervention** (login, 2FA, CAPTCHA)

Ask clarifying questions if:
- Target URL is ambiguous
- Required credentials are unclear
- Multiple paths exist to achieve the goal

### Step 2: Plan the Automation Sequence

Break down the workflow into discrete steps:

1. **Navigation steps**: Which pages to visit in order
2. **Interaction points**: Buttons to click, forms to fill, dropdowns to select
3. **Wait conditions**: When to wait for page loads, dynamic content
4. **User intervention points**: Where authentication or decisions are needed
5. **Data extraction points**: What information to capture
6. **Verification steps**: How to confirm success

Document the plan clearly before execution.

### Step 3: Initialize Browser Session

Start the browser session:

```
Use mcp__microsoft-playwright-mcp__browser_navigate to open the target URL
```

**Initial snapshot**: Always take a snapshot after navigation to understand page state:

```
Use mcp__microsoft-playwright-mcp__browser_snapshot
```

### Step 4: Execute Automated Steps

For each step in the plan that doesn't require user intervention:

1. **Take snapshot** to understand current page state
2. **Identify target elements** using human-readable descriptions and refs
3. **Perform action** (click, type, select, etc.)
4. **Verify result** by taking another snapshot or checking for expected changes
5. **Report progress** to user ("Navigated to API keys page...")

**Available actions**:
- `browser_click`: Click buttons, links, checkboxes
- `browser_type`: Enter text into input fields
- `browser_select_option`: Choose from dropdowns
- `browser_fill_form`: Fill multiple form fields at once
- `browser_drag`: Drag and drop elements
- `browser_press_key`: Press keyboard keys (Enter, Tab, etc.)
- `browser_wait_for`: Wait for text to appear/disappear or time to pass

**Best practices**:
- Always use human-readable element descriptions (e.g., "Submit button", "Email input field")
- Use exact `ref` values from snapshots for reliable targeting
- Wait for page loads after navigation or clicks
- Take snapshots frequently to verify state changes

### Step 4.5: Handle Google OAuth Login (Automated)

**When a Google social login option is detected, attempt automatic login:**

1. **Detect Google login button** in the snapshot:
   - Look for buttons with text like "Continue with Google", "Sign in with Google", "Google"
   - Common patterns: "Google", "google", "Continue with Google", "Sign in with Google"

2. **Attempt automated Google OAuth flow**:
   ```
   a. Click the Google login button
   b. Wait for Google OAuth page to load (2-3 seconds)
   c. Take snapshot to check current state
   d. If already logged in (account selection page):
      - Look for account email in the snapshot
      - Click on the account to select it
      - Wait for redirect back to the service
   e. If Google login page appears:
      - Report to user that manual login is needed
      - Follow Step 5 (User Intervention Pattern)
   ```

3. **Handle account selection**:
   - If multiple Google accounts are available, automatically select the first one
   - If user wants to use a different account, they can interrupt and specify

4. **Verify successful login**:
   - After account selection, wait for redirect
   - Take snapshot to confirm login success
   - Look for user profile indicators or dashboard elements

**Example flow**:
```
[Detected "Continue with Google" button]
‚Üí Clicking Google login button...
‚Üí Waiting for Google OAuth page...
‚Üí [Account selection page detected]
‚Üí Found account: user@gmail.com
‚Üí Selecting account...
‚Üí Waiting for redirect...
‚Üí ‚úì Successfully logged in with Google account
```

**Fallback to manual intervention**:
If any of these conditions occur, fall back to Step 5 (User Intervention):
- Google login page requires password entry
- 2FA/verification is required
- Account selection page shows no accounts
- Unexpected page state after clicking Google login

### Step 5: Handle User Intervention Points

When reaching a step requiring user action (login, 2FA, CAPTCHA):

1. **Take screenshot** of current state:
   ```
   Use mcp__microsoft-playwright-mcp__browser_take_screenshot
   ```

2. **Clearly explain** what the user needs to do:
   ```
   "I've navigated to the login page. Please log in with your credentials.
   Here's the current page: [screenshot]

   Once you've completed the login, reply with 'done' or 'continue'."
   ```

3. **Wait for user confirmation**: Pause execution until user signals completion

4. **Resume automation**: After user confirmation, take a new snapshot and continue

**Common intervention scenarios**:
- Login/authentication (non-Google) - Google OAuth is automated
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- CAPTCHA solving
- Security questions
- Important confirmations or approvals
- Manual data entry (when automation cannot access secure fields)

**Note**: Google OAuth login is handled automatically using persistent browser sessions. The browser maintains logged-in state across sessions, so account selection happens automatically.

### Step 6: Extract and Report Results

After completing the workflow:

1. **Capture final state**: Take snapshot or screenshot
2. **Extract target data**: Use `browser_evaluate` if needed for complex extraction
3. **Present results clearly**:
   ```
   "Successfully generated API key: [key-value]

   Summary:
   - Navigated to Vertex AI console
   - Selected project: [project-name]
   - Created API key: [key]

   The key has been saved to the console. [Screenshot attached]"
   ```

4. **Clean up** (optional): Close browser if workflow is complete

## User Intervention Pattern

**Detection**: Identify intervention needs by:
- Recognizing login/auth pages (presence of "password" fields, "sign in" buttons)
- Detecting CAPTCHA challenges
- Encountering permission requests or security prompts
- Hitting unexpected error states

**Communication template**:
```
[EMOJI: üîê] User action required

Current step: [describe what needs to be done]
Current page: [screenshot]

What you need to do:
1. [Specific instruction 1]
2. [Specific instruction 2]

Reply with "done" when complete, and I'll continue.
```

**Resumption**:
- Always take a fresh snapshot after user intervention
- Verify expected state change occurred
- If state is unexpected, ask user for clarification

## Error Handling

**Page load failures**:
- Wait up to 30 seconds for pages to load
- If timeout occurs, inform user and ask if they want to retry

**Element not found**:
- Take snapshot to show current page state
- Explain what element was expected vs. what's present
- Ask user if they want to adjust the approach

**Unexpected page states**:
- Show screenshot of current state
- Ask user for guidance on how to proceed

**Console errors**:
- Use `browser_console_messages` to check for JavaScript errors
- Report critical errors to user

## Best Practices

1. **Transparency**: Always explain what you're doing at each step
2. **Verification**: Take snapshots before and after critical actions
3. **Patience**: Use appropriate wait conditions for dynamic content
4. **User respect**: Never guess credentials or bypass security measures
5. **Screenshots for context**: Provide visual feedback at intervention points
6. **Progressive disclosure**: Don't overwhelm with technical details unless debugging
7. **Graceful degradation**: If automation fails, clearly explain what manual steps are needed
8. **Prefer Google OAuth**: When multiple login options exist, prioritize "Sign in with Google" for automatic authentication
9. **Persistent session awareness**: Leverage persistent browser sessions to avoid repeated logins across different tasks
10. **Account selection**: When multiple Google accounts are available, select the first one automatically (user can interrupt if needed)

## Common Scenarios

## Limitations

This skill cannot:
- Bypass security measures (CAPTCHA, 2FA) without user help
- Access password managers or autofill credentials (except Google OAuth via persistent browser)
- Perform actions requiring physical devices (hardware keys)
- Automate tasks on pages with heavy anti-bot protection
- Automatically handle non-Google authentication (GitHub, Apple, email/password, etc.)

**What IS automated**:
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth login (via persistent browser sessions)
- ‚úÖ Google account selection
- ‚úÖ Redirect after Google authentication

**What still requires user intervention**:
- ‚ùå Non-Google login methods
- ‚ùå 2FA/verification codes
- ‚ùå CAPTCHA challenges
- ‚ùå Password entry (even for Google if not already logged in)

For non-automated scenarios, the skill will pause and request user assistance explicitly.
