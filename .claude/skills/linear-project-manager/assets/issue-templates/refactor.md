# Refactor Template

## Why Refactor
[Current code issues or technical debt]

**Example**: API client uses callbacks instead of async/await, making code hard to read and maintain.

## What to Improve
[Describe the refactoring goal]

**Example**: Convert all API client methods from callback-based to async/await.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1: What should be better after refactoring?]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

**Example**:
- [ ] All API methods use async/await syntax
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] Code is more readable and maintainable

## Notes
[Optional: Performance considerations, breaking changes, migration strategy, etc.]

**Things to check**:
- Does this introduce breaking changes?
- Are there performance implications?
- Do we need to update documentation?

---

**Tips**:
- Keep functionality unchanged (no new features)
- Ensure tests pass before and after
- Document any API changes
