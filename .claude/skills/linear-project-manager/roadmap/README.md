# Linear Project Manager - Implementation Roadmap

This folder contains the 8-week implementation roadmap for building a fully automated Linear-based project management system.

## Structure

- **00-overview.md** - Complete 8-week roadmap summary
  - Architecture decisions
  - Core automation pipeline
  - Phase 1-3 expansion paths
  - Success metrics

- **01-week1-2-baseline.md** - Week 1-2 detailed guide
  - Daily reflection templates
  - Baseline metrics measurement
  - Manual workflow establishment
  - Pain point identification

- **02-week3-4-automation.md** (To be created)
  - Commit automation implementation
  - Post-commit hook setup
  - Background worker configuration
  - /auto-commit-process command

- **03-week5-6-metrics.md** (To be created)
  - Daily metrics collection
  - Weekly retrospective automation
  - ROI measurement (Before/After)

## Usage

**Current Week**: Week 1-2 (Baseline)

Start with:
1. Read `00-overview.md` for full context
2. Follow `01-week1-2-baseline.md` for daily actions
3. Execute daily reflections (5 min/day)
4. Complete Week 1 mini-retro on Friday

**As you progress:**
- Complete each week's tasks
- Document learnings and pain points
- Create new roadmap documents for future weeks
- Update `skill.md` and `references/` with implemented features

## Integration with Skill

This roadmap guides the **progressive enhancement** of the Linear skill:

- **Now (Week 1-2)**: `skill.md` contains manual workflows only
- **Week 3-4**: Add Workflow 6 (Commit Automation) after implementation
- **Week 5-6**: Add Workflow 7 (Metrics Collection) after implementation
- **Week 7-8**: Refine and document best practices

The skill evolves from "how to use Linear manually" to "how to run a fully automated system."
