# AI Collaborative Solver V2.0

**Phase 1: Pre-Clarification Only**

---

## When to Use

Trigger when users request:
- "AI 토론" / "AI debate"
- "토론해서" / "debate"
- Technical comparisons ("Django vs FastAPI")
- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimization advice

---

## How to Activate

**Step 1: Always Start with Pre-Clarification**

Before doing anything else, gather context from the user.

### If Information is Missing

Ask 2-3 clarifying questions:

**Template:**
```
AI 토론을 위해 몇 가지 확인하고 싶습니다:

1. [Tech stack / versions]
2. [Timeline / budget / team constraints]
3. [Goals / success criteria]
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Django vs FastAPI 선택 고민"

You: "AI 토론을 위해 몇 가지 확인하고 싶습니다:

1. 프로젝트 규모와 유형은? (팀 크기, 예상 사용자 수)
2. 팀의 기술 스택 경험은? (Python 수준, 프레임워크 경험)
3. 주요 우선순위는? (개발 속도, 성능, 학습곡선 중 중요한 것)"
```

### If Information is Complete

Show understanding summary and confirm:

**Template:**
```
📋 **제 이해:**
- [Main problem/goal]

🎯 **파악한 제약사항:**
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

🔍 **전제 조건:**
- [Assumption 1]

맞나요? 추가하거나 수정할 내용이 있나요?
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Django 4.2 + PostgreSQL 14 성능 개선 (2초→500ms, 1주일, DBA 없음)"

You: "📋 **제 이해:**
- Django 4.2 API 응답시간을 2초에서 500ms로 개선

🎯 **파악한 제약사항:**
- 기한: 1주일
- 인력: DBA 없음 (개발자 수준 최적화만 가능)
- 기술: Django 4.2, PostgreSQL 14

🔍 **전제 조건:**
- ORM N+1 쿼리 문제 가능성
- 코드 레벨 최적화 위주
- 인프라 변경 범위 제한적

맞나요? 추가하거나 수정할 내용이 있나요?"
```

---

## Step 2: After Clarification - Execute Debate

After clarification is complete and user confirms, proceed to **Phase 2: Independent Opinion Collection**.

### Phase 2: Independent Opinion Collection (Optimized)

**New approach:** You (main Claude) generate your own opinion first, then collect Codex's independent opinion. This eliminates the 34-second overhead of spawning a separate Claude Code session.

#### 2.1 Generate Your Own Independent Opinion

**CRITICAL:** Generate your analysis BEFORE calling Codex. This ensures independence.

Using the clarified context from Phase 1, provide your independent analysis:

**Your Analysis Structure:**
```markdown
## Claude Code Analysis

### Key Points (3-5 main insights)
[Your key insights based on the clarified question and context]

### Pros (advantages/supporting arguments)
- [Pro 1 with reasoning]
- [Pro 2 with reasoning]
- [Pro 3 with reasoning]

### Cons (disadvantages/opposing arguments)
- [Con 1 with reasoning]
- [Con 2 with reasoning]
- [Con 3 with reasoning]

### Recommendation
[Your conclusion with clear reasoning]
```

**Important notes:**
- Be specific and objective
- Base analysis on the clarified constraints from Phase 1
- Don't wait for Codex's opinion - generate yours independently first
- Save your analysis to a variable or session output directory

#### 2.2 Collect Codex Opinion (Single Agent)

Now execute Codex to get an independent second opinion:

```bash
# Get script path
SCRIPTS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/ai-collaborative-solver-v2.0/scripts"

# Build prompt for Codex with full context
CODEX_PROMPT="You are an independent expert analyst. You have NOT seen any other AI's opinion yet.

## Clarified Question
[Insert question from Phase 1]

## Context & Constraints
[Insert all gathered context from Phase 1]

## Your Task
Provide your independent analysis:

1. **Key Points** (3-5 main insights)
2. **Pros** (advantages/supporting arguments)
3. **Cons** (disadvantages/opposing arguments)
4. **Recommendation** (your conclusion with reasoning)

Be specific and provide clear reasoning for each point."

# Execute Codex only (fast, no file creation)
CODEX_OPINION=$(bash "$SCRIPTS_DIR/codex-session.sh" new "$CODEX_PROMPT" --stdout-only --quiet 2>&1)

echo "Codex opinion collected successfully"
```

**Performance improvements vs old approach:**
- **Old:** 2 agents in parallel (Codex + Claude Code) = 55s
- **New:** 1 agent only (Codex) = ~13s
- **Speedup:** 75% faster! (42 seconds saved)
- No separate Claude Code session spawn overhead
- No file I/O overhead (uses --stdout-only)

#### 2.3 Compare Your Opinion with Codex's Opinion

Now you have two independent opinions:
1. **Your analysis** (from 2.1) - already generated
2. **Codex's opinion** (from 2.2) - captured in `$CODEX_OPINION`

Read both carefully and prepare for synthesis.

#### 2.4 Analyze and Synthesize

**IMPORTANT**: Perform this analysis systematically and objectively. Compare your opinion (from 2.1) with Codex's opinion (from 2.2).

**Step 1: Identify Common Ground**

Review both opinions and extract points of agreement:

```
Action: Read through both opinions carefully
Look for:
  - Similar key points or insights
  - Matching recommendations
  - Shared concerns or priorities
  - Common technical assessments

Example:
Your opinion: "Django provides better admin interface"
Codex opinion: "Django's built-in admin is a major advantage"
→ Common ground: Both agree Django admin is valuable
```

**Step 2: Highlight Differences**

Identify where opinions diverge and understand why:

```
Action: Compare contrasting viewpoints
Look for:
  - Different recommendations
  - Opposing priorities (speed vs stability, etc.)
  - Conflicting technical assessments
  - Different risk evaluations

Example:
Your opinion: "FastAPI is better for this team (async expertise)"
Codex opinion: "Django is better for this team (proven stability)"
→ Difference: Trade-off between modern features vs proven reliability
→ Root cause: Different weighting of team skill vs project risk
```

**Step 3: Extract Unique Insights**

Find what each perspective uniquely contributes:

```
Your unique insights:
  - What did you emphasize that Codex didn't?
  - What angle did you take that's distinctive?
  - Example: "You focused on team morale and modern tech stack appeal"

Codex unique insights:
  - What did Codex highlight that you missed?
  - What novel consideration did Codex raise?
  - Example: "Codex emphasized ecosystem maturity and hiring pool"

Why these insights matter:
  - Unique insights reveal blind spots
  - They enrich the final analysis
  - They show the value of multiple perspectives
```

**Step 4: Synthesize Final Recommendation**

Create a balanced recommendation that considers both perspectives:

```
Process:
1. Count agreement vs disagreement points
   - If 70%+ agreement → High confidence, synthesize toward consensus
   - If 40-70% agreement → Medium confidence, present balanced view
   - If <40% agreement → Low confidence, present options

2. Weight the opinions:
   - If both strongly agree → Strong recommendation
   - If one strong, one weak → Moderate recommendation
   - If both disagree → Present trade-offs, let user decide

3. Address conflicts explicitly:
   - "While [your opinion] suggests X, [Codex] raises concern about Y"
   - "The trade-off is between [benefit A] and [cost B]"
   - "This depends on whether [assumption 1] or [assumption 2] holds"

4. Formulate final recommendation:
   - State clear conclusion
   - Explain reasoning (why this balances both views)
   - Provide confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
   - Give actionable next steps

Example synthesis:
"Given the 3-month timeline and team's lack of async experience, Django
is the safer choice despite FastAPI's performance benefits. While your
analysis correctly identifies FastAPI's modern advantages, Codex's concern
about learning curve risk is more critical given the timeline constraint.
Confidence: High (both agree timeline is tight, prioritize stability)."
```

### Phase 3: Round 2 - Constructive Challenge (v4.0)

**Objective**: Each agent reviews the other's opinion and provides constructive criticism to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas needing clarification or evidence.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase enables true debate dynamics - not "rebuttal for rebuttal's sake", but productive challenge that refines thinking and exposes blind spots.

#### 3.1 Main Claude Challenges Codex Opinion

**When to execute**: Only when user selected "예, Phase 3-4 진행" above.

**Your task**: Review Codex's opinion and provide CONSTRUCTIVE challenge.

**Guidelines - Follow this structure exactly**:

```markdown
## Main Claude's Challenge to Codex

✅ **Strengths Acknowledged** (2-3 points)
What did Codex get right? Which arguments are solid and well-reasoned?

1. [Strength 1 - specific point from Codex opinion]
2. [Strength 2 - why this argument is valid]
3. [Strength 3 - technical merit or insight]

⚠️ **Clarifying Questions** (2-3 questions)
NOT rhetorical attacks - genuine gaps in understanding or specification.

1. [Question 1 - about edge case, constraint, or assumption]
   - Context: Why this matters for the decision
   - Example: "You mentioned X, but what about scenario Y?"

2. [Question 2 - about missing consideration]
   - Context: Why this could affect the recommendation

❌ **Weak Spots Identified** (1-3 issues)
Logical inconsistencies, overlooked risks, or unsupported claims.

1. [Issue 1 - what's problematic]
   - Why it's a problem: [logical flaw or missing consideration]
   - Alternative view: [counter-argument or risk]

2. [Issue 2 - if applicable]
   - Impact: [how this affects the conclusion]

📊 **Evidence Requested** (if applicable)
Claims that need data, benchmarks, or case studies to validate.

1. [Claim 1 from Codex] - What evidence would support or refute this?
   - Suggested search: "[benchmark/comparison/case study]"

2. [Claim 2] - What data is needed?
```

**Example**:

```markdown
## Main Claude's Challenge to Codex

✅ **Strengths Acknowledged:**
1. Codex correctly identifies FastAPI's async performance advantage - this is well-documented
2. The point about type safety and modern Python features is valid and important
3. Strong emphasis on developer experience and ecosystem growth is insightful

⚠️ **Clarifying Questions:**
1. You recommend FastAPI for "modern async patterns" - does the team actually have async/await experience?
   - Context: If not, this becomes a learning curve liability in a 3-month timeline

2. You mention "ecosystem maturity" concerns for Django - but isn't Django 15+ years old with massive ecosystem?
   - Clarification needed: Are you referring to async-specific ecosystem?

❌ **Weak Spots Identified:**
1. **Performance claim oversimplified**
   - You cite "5x faster" but at 10k DAU (daily active users), not concurrent users
   - Impact: At this scale, both frameworks handle load fine - performance difference may not matter

2. **Learning curve minimized**
   - FastAPI + async + Pydantic + SQLAlchemy is 4 new concepts for a team used to Django
   - Risk: 3-month timeline is tight for learning + building

📊 **Evidence Requested:**
1. "FastAPI is 5x faster" - need benchmark at 10k concurrent (not just req/s tests)
   - Suggested search: "FastAPI vs Django benchmark 10000 concurrent users real-world"

2. "Smaller ecosystem" concern - quantify: how many fewer libraries/integrations?
   - Suggested search: "Django REST Framework packages vs FastAPI ecosystem 2024"
```

**Execution**:
You don't need to call any script - you are Main Claude, so analyze and write directly.

---

#### 3.2 Codex Challenges Main Claude Opinion

**When to execute**: In parallel with 3.1 (or immediately after), to get Codex's perspective on your opinion.

**How to execute**: Use codex-session.sh with challenge prompt.

**Command**:

```bash
SCRIPTS_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/ai-collaborative-solver-v2.0/scripts"

# Build challenge prompt for Codex
CODEX_CHALLENGE_PROMPT="You are reviewing Main Claude's technical opinion and providing constructive challenge.

**CRITICAL**: Follow this EXACT structure. Use these emoji markers:
✅ Strengths Acknowledged (2-3 points)
⚠️ Clarifying Questions (2-3 questions)
❌ Weak Spots Identified (1-3 issues)
📊 Evidence Requested (if applicable)

## Context
Question: [Insert clarified question from Phase 1]
Constraints: [Insert key constraints]

## Main Claude's Opinion
[Paste your complete Phase 2.1 opinion here]

## Your Task
Provide constructive challenge following the structure above:

1. ✅ **Strengths**: What did Main Claude get right? (2-3 specific points)

2. ⚠️ **Questions**: Genuine gaps or missing considerations (2-3 questions with context)

3. ❌ **Weak Spots**: Logical flaws, overlooked risks, unsupported claims (1-3 issues with impact)

4. 📊 **Evidence Requested**: Claims needing data/benchmarks (if any)

Be specific, constructive, and focus on improving the final recommendation."

# Execute Codex challenge (parallel with your challenge, or sequential)
CODEX_CHALLENGE=$(bash "$SCRIPTS_DIR/codex-session.sh" new "$CODEX_CHALLENGE_PROMPT" --stdout-only --quiet 2>&1)

echo "Codex challenge collected successfully"
```

**Performance**:
- Phase 3.1 (your challenge): ~5-10s (text generation)
- Phase 3.2 (Codex challenge): ~15-20s (API call)
- **Total if parallel**: ~20s (overlapped)
- **Total if sequential**: ~25-30s

**Note**: For v4.0, run sequentially (simpler). For v4.1+, optimize with parallel execution.

---

#### 3.3 Review Challenges

Now you have:
1. **Your challenge to Codex** (from 3.1)
2. **Codex's challenge to you** (from 3.2)

Read both challenges carefully. These will be addressed in Phase 4.

**Quick sanity check**:
- Are the challenges constructive, not adversarial?
- Do they ask genuine questions (not rhetorical)?
- Do they identify real weaknesses (not nitpicking)?
- Is evidence requested for claims (not trivial points)?

If challenges seem unproductive or generic, you may need to refine the prompts in future iterations.

**Proceed to Phase 4**: Evidence-Based Refinement

---

### Phase 4: Round 3 - Evidence-Based Refinement (v4.0)

**Objective**: Respond to challenges from Phase 3, provide evidence for claims, acknowledge valid criticisms, and refine original positions.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase transforms debate into collaborative improvement - not defending positions, but finding truth through evidence and reasoning.

#### 4.1 Main Claude Responds to Codex's Challenge

**Input**: Codex's challenge to your opinion (from Phase 3.2)

**Your task**: Address each section of Codex's challenge systematically.

**Response Structure**:

```markdown
## Main Claude's Response to Codex's Challenge

### Addressing Questions

**Q1: [Codex's question]**
A: [Your answer OR "Valid point - I don't have enough information. This needs clarification from user."]

**Q2: [Codex's question]**
A: [Your answer with reasoning]

### Addressing Weak Spots

**Issue 1: [Codex identified issue]**
✅ **Acknowledged** OR ⚠️ **Counter-argument**

If acknowledged:
- Why it's valid: [explain]
- How it changes view: [updated position]

If counter-argument:
- Why the criticism doesn't hold: [reasoning]
- Supporting evidence: [if available]

**Issue 2: [If applicable]**
[Same structure]

### Evidence Gathering

**Claim 1: [Codex requested evidence for]**
🔍 **Evidence Search**: [If needed, use WebSearch tool]
📊 **Found**:
- [Evidence source 1]: [Summary]
- [Evidence source 2]: [Summary]
✅ **Conclusion**: [How evidence supports/refutes claim]

**Claim 2: [If applicable]**
[Same structure]

### Updated Position

**Original**: [Your Phase 2.1 recommendation]
**After addressing challenges**: [Refined recommendation]
**Changes**:
- [What changed and why]
- [What remains the same]

**Confidence**: [Original level] → [New level] (Higher/Same/Lower)
**Reasoning**: [Why confidence changed or stayed]
```

**WebSearch Integration**:

When Codex requests evidence, use the WebSearch tool:

```
If challenge includes "📊 Evidence Requested", determine what to search:

Example:
Codex asks: "Need benchmark for FastAPI vs Django at 10k concurrent users"

Action:
1. Use WebSearch tool with query: "FastAPI Django benchmark 10000 concurrent users performance"
2. Review top 3 results
3. Summarize findings with sources

Format:
🔍 **Evidence Search**: "FastAPI Django benchmark 10k concurrent"
📊 **Found**:
- TechEmpower Benchmarks (techempower.com): FastAPI 25k req/s, Django 5k req/s
- Real Python article (realpython.com): "At 10k DAU, both handle load fine"
- Stack Overflow discussion: "Performance difference negligible at <50k concurrent"

✅ **Conclusion**: Codex was correct on raw performance (5x faster), but at 10k DAU scale, difference is not a deciding factor. Both frameworks sufficient.
```

**Example Response**:

```markdown
## Main Claude's Response to Codex's Challenge

### Addressing Questions

**Q1: Does the team actually have async/await experience?**
A: ✅ **Valid point** - I assumed team Python experience = async experience. This needs user clarification.
   - If NO async experience → Django safer (Codex concern justified)
   - If YES async experience → FastAPI feasible

**Critical follow-up**: User, does your team have async/await experience in Python?

**Q2: "Ecosystem maturity" concern - clarify async-specific or general?**
A: You're right to push back. Django has massive ecosystem overall. I meant async-specific ecosystem (e.g., async-compatible libraries). Updated: "Django's async ecosystem is less mature than FastAPI's, but sync ecosystem is larger."

### Addressing Weak Spots

**Issue 1: Performance claim oversimplified (10k DAU vs concurrent)**
✅ **Acknowledged**: You're absolutely correct.

🔍 **Evidence Search**: "FastAPI Django 10k daily active users"
📊 **Found**:
- TechEmpower: FastAPI 25k req/s vs Django 5k req/s (raw benchmarks)
- Real Python: "At 10k DAU (~500 concurrent), both handle easily"

✅ **Refined**: Performance advantage exists but NOT critical at this scale. Both sufficient for 10k DAU.

**Issue 2: Learning curve minimized**
⚠️ **Partially acknowledged**:
- True: FastAPI + async + Pydantic is 3 new concepts
- But: If team already knows SQLAlchemy, only 2 new concepts
- Counter: Django + DRF also has learning curve (serializers, viewsets, etc.)

📊 **Evidence**:
- FastAPI tutorial: ~3 days for basic CRUD (official docs)
- DRF tutorial: ~2 days for basic CRUD (official docs)

✅ **Refined**: Learning curves comparable (FastAPI: 3 days, DRF: 2 days). 3-month timeline accommodates either.

### Evidence Gathering

**Claim: "Smaller ecosystem"**
🔍 **Evidence Search**: "Django REST Framework vs FastAPI ecosystem size 2024"
📊 **Found**:
- Django packages: 4,000+ on djangopackages.org
- FastAPI integrations: 500+ on awesome-fastapi GitHub
- But: FastAPI uses standard Python libs (not framework-specific)

✅ **Conclusion**: Django has 8x more framework-specific packages, but FastAPI leverages broader Python ecosystem. "Smaller" is context-dependent.

### Updated Position

**Original**: Django recommended (emphasis on stability + timeline)
**After addressing challenges**:
- IF team lacks async experience → Django (Codex point valid)
- IF team has async experience → FastAPI feasible

**Changes**:
- Added conditional: async experience is decisive factor
- Performance argument weakened (not critical at 10k DAU)
- Learning curve reassessed (comparable, not blocking)

**Confidence**: Medium (60%) → Medium-High (70%)
**Reasoning**: Codex challenges refined analysis, but added conditionality rather than changing core recommendation.
```

- **Total if parallel**: ~20-30s
- **Total if sequential**: ~30-50s

**Note**: WebSearch may add 10-20s per evidence request. Budget accordingly.

---

#### 4.3 Review Refined Positions

Now you have:
1. **Your refined opinion** (from 4.1) - after addressing Codex challenges
2. **Codex's refined opinion** (from 4.2) - after addressing your challenges

**Quick assessment**:
- Did opinions converge (more agreement now)?
- Did new evidence change recommendations?
- Are there still unresolved differences?
- Is more evidence needed, or is analysis sufficient?

**Decision point**:
- If **converged**: Proceed to Phase 5 (User Intervention) or Phase 6 (Final Synthesis)
- If **still divergent but evidence-backed**: Proceed to Phase 5 for user input
- If **evidence insufficient**: Consider another evidence-gathering round (rare, v4.1+ feature)

**Proceed to Phase 5**: User Intervention Point

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

**Phase 1 (Clarification):**
1. **Always clarify first** - Even if it seems obvious
2. **Use the templates** - Maintains consistency
3. **Wait for user response** - Don't assume or skip
4. **Summarize if info is complete** - Builds trust

**Phase 2 (Debate):**
1. **Generate your opinion FIRST** - Before calling Codex, ensures independence
2. **Include all Phase 1 context** - Pass clarified info to Codex prompt
3. **Use fast mode (--stdout-only --quiet)** - Minimize overhead
4. **Analyze objectively** - Compare your opinion with Codex fairly
5. **Highlight both agreement and disagreement** - Both are valuable

### ❌ Don'ts

**Phase 1 (Clarification):**
1. **Don't skip to debate** - Clarification is mandatory
2. **Don't ask too many questions** - 2-3 max
3. **Don't make assumptions** - Ask or state clearly
4. **Don't proceed without confirmation** - Wait for user "yes"

**Phase 2 (Debate):**
1. **Don't wait for Codex before generating your opinion** - Generate yours first
2. **Don't cherry-pick opinions** - Present both viewpoints fairly
3. **Don't ignore unique insights** - Both perspectives are valuable
4. **Don't skip synthesis** - Users need actionable conclusions

## Examples

### Example 1: Minimal Info → Ask Questions

```
User: "Redis vs Memcached"

You: "AI 토론을 위해 몇 가지 확인하고 싶습니다:

1. 주요 사용 목적은? (캐싱, 세션 저장, 메시지 큐 등)
2. 예상 규모는? (초당 요청 수, 데이터 크기)
3. 팀의 운영 경험은? (Redis/Memcached 사용 경험 유무)"

User: "세션 저장용이고, 초당 1000 req, 데이터는 작음. Redis 경험 없음."

You: "감사합니다. 이제 AI 토론을 시작하겠습니다.

먼저 제 분석부터 드리겠습니다...
[Your analysis]

이제 Codex의 독립적인 의견을 수집하겠습니다...
[Calls Codex]

두 의견을 비교 분석한 결과...
[Synthesis]"
```

### Example 2: Complete Info → Confirm Understanding

```
User: "Next.js 14 vs Remix, 5인 팀, React 경험 많음, SEO 중요, 3개월 타임라인"

You: "📋 **제 이해:**
- Next.js 14와 Remix 중 선택

🎯 **파악한 제약사항:**
- 팀: 5명, React 경험 풍부
- 요구사항: SEO 중요
- 기한: 3개월

🔍 **전제 조건:**
- SSR/SSG 필요
- 팀 학습곡선 고려 필요
- 프로덕션 안정성 중요

맞나요?"

User: "네 맞습니다"

You: "좋습니다. 이제 AI 토론을 진행하겠습니다.

- [x] No errors or confusion in flow

### Phase 2 (Debate) - ✅ Complete

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Main Claude generates independent opinion first (Phase 2.1)
- [x] Successfully launches Codex session (Phase 2.2)
- [x] Codex opinion is properly collected (Phase 2.3)
- [x] Synthesis identifies agreement/disagreement correctly (Phase 2.4 - ✅ Implemented)
- [x] Output is clear and actionable (Phase 2.5 - ✅ Implemented)

**Implementation Status:**
- Phase 2.1-2.3: ✅ Complete (opinion collection)
- Phase 2.4: ✅ Complete (4-step synthesis with concrete instructions)
- Phase 2.5: ✅ Complete (structured output template with fill instructions)

**Performance:**
- Old v2.0: 54s (2 agents in parallel)
- New v3.1: ~26s (Main Claude + Codex, with synthesis)
- Improvement: 52% faster!

## Bundled Scripts

This skill includes helper scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

### Session Manager (Active)
- **`codex-session.sh`** - Manages stateful Codex CLI sessions
  - Supports `--stdout-only --quiet` for fast, minimal-overhead execution
  - API: `new`, `continue`, `info`, `list`, `clean`
  - Used by main Claude to collect Codex's independent opinion

### Legacy Scripts (Not Used in v3.0)
- **`claude-code-session.sh`** - Previously used for spawning separate Claude sessions (removed in v3.0 for performance)
- **`gemini-cli-session.sh`** - Previously used for 3-agent debates (removed due to reliability issues)
- **`collect-opinions.sh`** - Old parallel orchestrator (replaced by direct main Claude opinion generation)

**Usage**: Only `codex-session.sh` is actively used in Phase 2.2. Main Claude generates its own opinion directly without spawning a separate session.
