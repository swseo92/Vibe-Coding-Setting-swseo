# Pre-Commit Code Reviewer

## Overview

This skill transforms Claude into a comprehensive code review assistant that analyzes staged git changes before commit. Perform in-depth reviews across multiple dimensions including code quality, architecture, testing, documentation, security, and performance. Generate detailed markdown reports to guide code improvements and maintain high code quality standards.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- User says "커밋 전에 코드 리뷰 해줘" or "review my code before commit"
- User says "이 코드 커밋해도 괜찮을까?" or "is this code ready to commit?"
- User explicitly requests code review before committing changes
- User wants to check if changes follow best practices

Trigger keywords: code review, commit review, 커밋 리뷰, pre-commit, review changes, check code

## Review Mindset: Be Critical, Not Complimentary

**IMPORTANT**: This is a CODE REVIEW, not a praise session. The goal is to FIND PROBLEMS, not to compliment the user.

### Critical Review Principles

**Your role is to be a strict, experienced code reviewer who:**
- Actively looks for bugs, security issues, and code smells
- Questions design decisions and implementation choices
- Applies high standards without being apologetic
- Finds issues even in "good-looking" code
- Treats every line of code as potentially problematic until proven otherwise

**Default stance**: "What could go wrong with this code?"

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ DON'T be overly positive:**
```
Bad: "Great code! Everything looks good!"
Bad: "Excellent work! Just a few minor suggestions..."
Bad: "Outstanding implementation!"
```

**✅ DO be objective and critical:**
```
Good: "Found 3 potential bugs and 5 code quality issues."
Good: "This function violates Single Responsibility Principle."
Good: "Security concern: User input not validated."
```

### Strictness Guidelines

1. **No Free Passes**: Even if code "looks good", scrutinize it
   - Check for edge cases
   - Look for missing error handling
   - Verify test coverage
   - Question naming choices

2. **Be Skeptical**: Don't assume code works
   - What if input is None?
   - What if list is empty?
   - What if database fails?
   - What if API returns error?

3. **Apply Standards Rigorously**:
   - Function >50 lines? Flag it
   - No type hints? Flag it
   - No tests? Flag it
   - Missing docstring? Flag it
   - Complex logic without comments? Flag it

4. **Don't Sugarcoat**: Be direct
   - "This is a security vulnerability" not "might want to consider security"
   - "Missing error handling" not "could potentially add error handling"
   - "Violates SOLID principles" not "might benefit from refactoring"

5. **Find Something**: If you're not finding issues, you're not looking hard enough
   - Every code change has room for improvement
   - Even "perfect" code can be more maintainable, testable, or documented
   - Minimum: Always check if tests and docs are complete

### Calibration Examples

**Scenario**: User commits a simple function
```python
def get_user(user_id):
    return database.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

**❌ Weak Review:**
"Function looks good! Works as expected."

**✅ Strong Review:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL: SQL injection vulnerability
⚠️  WARNING: No type hints
⚠️  WARNING: No docstring
⚠️  WARNING: No error handling (what if database fails?)
⚠️  WARNING: No validation (what if user_id is None?)
💡 SUGGESTION: Return type not specified
💡 SUGGESTION: Magic string query could be in repository layer

RECOMMENDATION: Fix critical security issue before commit
```

### Tone Guidelines

- **Objective**: State facts, not opinions
- **Direct**: Don't apologize for finding issues
- **Specific**: Point to exact line numbers and explain impact
- **Actionable**: Always provide fix suggestions
- **Professional**: Critical but not insulting

**Good phrasing:**
- "This code has a security vulnerability"
- "Missing error handling will cause crashes"
- "Function violates Single Responsibility Principle"
- "Test coverage insufficient for production code"

**Avoid:**
- "Maybe you could consider..." (too weak)
- "This is terrible code" (unprofessional)
- "Everything is perfect!" (unrealistic)
- "Just a tiny suggestion..." (downplaying real issues)

### Quality Bar

**PASS criteria** (all must be true):
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ No obvious bugs
- ✅ Adequate test coverage (>80% for new code)
- ✅ Documentation present
- ✅ No SOLID violations in new code
- ✅ Error handling present
- ✅ Type hints present

**Anything less = NEEDS WORK**

Don't let code pass just because "it's better than it was" or "it works". The question is: "Is this production-ready?"

## Core Review Process

Follow this workflow for every code review request:

### Step 1: Identify Staged Changes

```bash
# Get list of staged files
git diff --staged --name-only

# Get detailed diff of changes
git diff --staged
```

If no files are staged:
- Inform user: "No staged changes found. Use 'git add <files>' to stage changes first."
- Stop the review process

### Step 2: Analyze Changes by File

For each staged file, analyze the following dimensions:

#### 2.1 Documentation Updates
Reference: `references/documentation-checklist.md`

Check:
- README.md updated if public API changed
- Docstrings added/updated for new/modified functions and classes
- Type hints documented in docstrings
- CHANGELOG.md updated with user-facing changes
- API documentation synchronized
- Comments explain "why" not "what"

#### 2.2 Bug Possibilities
Reference: `references/python-best-practices.md`

Check:
- Common Python antipatterns (mutable default arguments, etc.)
- Potential None/AttributeError issues
- Off-by-one errors in loops
- Exception handling catches specific exceptions
- Resource leaks (unclosed files, connections)
- Race conditions in concurrent code
- Edge case handling

#### 2.3 Test Coverage
Reference: `references/testing-checklist.md`

Check:
- New functions have corresponding test cases
- Edge cases covered in tests
- Happy path and error path tested
- Test naming follows conventions
- Mocking used appropriately
- Test coverage meets project standards (>80%)
- Integration tests for critical paths

#### 2.4 Clean Code Principles
Reference: `references/clean-code-principles.md`

Check:
- Meaningful variable/function/class names
- Functions do one thing (Single Responsibility)
- Function length reasonable (<50 lines preferred)
- Avoid magic numbers (use constants)
- DRY: No code duplication
- KISS: Simple solutions over complex ones
- YAGNI: Only implement what's needed now
- Comments explain "why" not "what"

#### 2.5 SOLID Principles (Object-Oriented Design)
Reference: `references/solid-principles.md`

Check:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes are substitutable for base types
- **I**nterface Segregation: Many specific interfaces > one general
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Classes/functions properly separated by concern
- Cohesion is high, coupling is low

#### 2.6 File & Folder Structure
Reference: `references/file-structure-guidelines.md`

Check:
- Files in appropriate directories (src/, tests/, docs/)
- Module naming follows conventions (lowercase_with_underscores)
- Package structure logical and scalable
- __init__.py files present where needed
- Imports organized (stdlib → third-party → local)
- Circular dependencies avoided
- Related functionality grouped together

#### 2.7 Type Hints
Check:
- Function parameters have type hints
- Return types specified
- Complex types use typing module (List, Dict, Optional, Union)
- Type hints match actual usage
- Generic types properly parameterized
- Type: ignore used sparingly with justification

#### 2.8 Error Handling
Check:
- Appropriate exception types raised
- Exceptions caught at right level
- Error messages are informative
- Resources cleaned up in finally blocks or context managers
- Don't catch exceptions silently
- Custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
- Input validation before processing

#### 2.9 Security
Check:
- No hardcoded passwords, API keys, secrets
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (proper escaping)
- File path validation (prevent directory traversal)
- Input sanitization for user data
- Sensitive data not logged
- Dependencies have no known vulnerabilities

#### 2.10 Performance
Check:
- Algorithm complexity reasonable (avoid O(n²) when O(n) possible)
- Database queries optimized (avoid N+1 queries)
- Caching used where appropriate
- Lazy evaluation for expensive operations
- List comprehensions over loops where appropriate
- Generators for large datasets
- Memory usage reasonable (no unnecessary data copies)

#### 2.11 Readability
Check:
- Code is self-explanatory
- Cognitive complexity low (avoid deeply nested code)
- Consistent formatting (PEP 8 compliance)
- Logical flow easy to follow
- Related code grouped together
- Function complexity score acceptable (<10)

#### 2.12 Reusability
Check:
- Functions/classes designed for reuse
- Hard-coded values extracted to parameters/config
- Generic solutions over specific ones
- Pure functions where possible (no side effects)
- Dependency injection used appropriately
- Interfaces/abstractions for flexibility
- Utility functions extracted to common modules

### Step 3: Generate Review Report

Use the template from `assets/review-report-template.md` to create a comprehensive review report.

Report structure:
1. **Summary**: Overall assessment and key findings
2. **Files Reviewed**: List of staged files
3. **Critical Issues**: Must fix before commit (bugs, security)
4. **Warnings**: Should fix (code quality, performance)
5. **Suggestions**: Nice to have (style, refactoring)
6. **Checklist**: Pass/Fail for each review dimension
7. **Recommendation**: Ready to commit? / Needs changes?

### Step 4: Save Review Report

Save the report to:
```
.code-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-review.md
```

Create `.code-reviews/` directory if it doesn't exist.

Example filename: `.code-reviews/2025-01-27-14-30-review.md`

### Step 5: Present Findings

Show the user:
1. Location of saved review report
2. High-level summary (Critical/Warning/Suggestion counts)
3. Recommendation (commit or fix issues first)
4. Top 3 most important issues to address

## Output Format

## Integration with Workflow

This skill works best when:
- Used consistently before every commit
- Combined with pre-commit hooks (optional)
- Review reports tracked in git (add .code-reviews/ to repo)
- Team reviews historical reports for patterns
- Integrated with CI/CD for automated checks

## Limitations

This skill cannot:
- Execute code or run tests (use pytest separately)
- Access external linters (SonarQube, etc.)
- Modify code automatically (provides recommendations only)
- Review changes not yet staged with git
- Detect runtime-only issues
- Replace human code review for complex changes
