# Pre-Commit Code Reviewer (Codex-Powered)

## Overview

This skill uses **OpenAI Codex CLI** (GPT-5-Codex model) as an LLM judge to perform comprehensive code reviews before commit. Get objective, scored assessments (0-100) with categorized issues (critical/warning/suggestion) and detailed improvement recommendations.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- OpenAI Codex CLI installed: `npm i -g @openai/codex`
- ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription (or OpenAI API access)
- Git repository with staged changes

**Verify:**
```bash
codex --version
# Should show: codex-cli 0.50.0 or higher
```

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- User says "Ïª§Î∞ã Ï†ÑÏóê ÏΩîÎìú Î¶¨Î∑∞ Ìï¥Ï§ò" or "review my code before commit"
- User says "Ïù¥ ÏΩîÎìú Ïª§Î∞ãÌï¥ÎèÑ Í¥úÏ∞ÆÏùÑÍπå?" or "is this code ready to commit?"
- User explicitly requests code review before committing changes
- User wants to check if changes follow best practices
- User says "pre-commit review" or "check before commit"

Trigger keywords: code review, commit review, Ïª§Î∞ã Î¶¨Î∑∞, pre-commit, review changes, check code

## Review Mindset: Be Critical, Not Complimentary

**IMPORTANT**: This is a CODE REVIEW, not a praise session. Codex is configured to FIND PROBLEMS.

### Critical Review Principles

Codex is instructed to:
- Actively look for bugs, security issues, and code smells
- Question design decisions and implementation choices
- Apply high standards without being apologetic
- Find issues even in "good-looking" code
- Treat every line of code as potentially problematic

**Default stance**: "What could go wrong with this code?"

### Quality Bar

**PASS criteria** (all must be true):
- ‚úÖ Score ‚â• 70/100
- ‚úÖ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ No obvious bugs
- ‚úÖ Adequate test coverage
- ‚úÖ Documentation present
- ‚úÖ Error handling present

**Anything less = NEEDS WORK**

## Core Review Process

Follow this workflow for every code review request:

### Step 1: Verify Codex CLI Installation

```bash
codex --version
```

If not installed, inform user:
```
‚ùå Codex CLI not found.

Install with:
  npm i -g @openai/codex

Then authenticate with ChatGPT Plus account:
  codex
```

### Step 2: Identify Staged Changes

```bash
# Get list of staged files
git diff --staged --name-only

# Get detailed diff
git diff --staged
```

If no files are staged:
- Inform user: "No staged changes found. Use 'git add <files>' to stage changes first."
- Stop the review process

### Step 3: Call Codex CLI for Review

Execute Codex CLI with structured prompt:

```bash
codex exec "Act as an expert LLM judge performing critical code review for commit readiness.

Review the following aspects with HIGH STANDARDS:
- Bugs and correctness
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, auth issues, etc.)
- Performance issues (algorithm complexity, N+1 queries, memory leaks)
- Code quality and readability (naming, complexity, duplication)
- Best practices adherence (SOLID, DRY, type hints, error handling)
- Test coverage (do tests exist for new code?)
- Documentation (docstrings, comments, README updates)

Your role is to FIND PROBLEMS, not to praise. Be critical and thorough.

Provide response in this EXACT format:

OVERALL SCORE: X/100

CRITICAL ISSUES (must fix before commit):
- [file:line] Description and impact
- [file:line] Description and impact

WARNINGS (should fix):
- [file:line] Description
- [file:line] Description

SUGGESTIONS (nice to have):
- [file:line] Description
- [file:line] Description

RECOMMENDATION: [commit | needs_work | major_refactor]

SUMMARY: [2-3 sentence critical assessment]

Here's the git diff to review:
$(git diff --staged)
"
```

**Important flags:**
- Default mode is `--mode suggest` (read-only, safe)
- Codex won't modify files during review
- Review only, no auto-fixing

### Step 4: Parse Codex Response

Extract key information:
- Overall score (0-100)
- Critical issue count
- Warning count
- Suggestion count
- Recommendation (commit/needs_work/major_refactor)
- Summary

**Example Codex output:**
```
OVERALL SCORE: 65/100

CRITICAL ISSUES (must fix before commit):
- [user.py:45] SQL injection risk: f-string allows arbitrary SQL execution

WARNINGS (should fix):
- [user.py:15] Missing type hints reduces type safety
- [test_user.py:20] Insufficient test coverage for error cases

SUGGESTIONS (nice to have):
- [user.py:50] Function too complex, consider splitting
- [user.py:1] Add module-level docstring

RECOMMENDATION: needs_work

SUMMARY: Critical SQL injection vulnerability must be addressed before commit. Code also lacks type hints and comprehensive tests. Fix security issue and add type safety before merging.
```

### Step 5: Generate Review Report

Create comprehensive markdown report using template:

**Template structure:**
```markdown
# Code Review Report - [Date Time]

**Reviewer:** OpenAI Codex (GPT-5-Codex)
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Overall Score:** X/100

| 0-59 | F | Poor | üî¥ Major refactoring needed |

**Critical issues always block commit, regardless of score.**

## Advanced Usage

### Option 1: Quick Review (Default)

```bash
# Standard review mode
codex exec "Review this diff: $(git diff --staged)"
```

### Option 2: Detailed Review

```bash
# Request more detailed analysis
codex exec "Perform VERY thorough code review with detailed explanations for each issue. Include code examples for fixes: $(git diff --staged)"
```

### Option 3: Specific Aspect Review

```bash
# Focus on security only
codex exec "Review this diff ONLY for security vulnerabilities. Be extremely thorough: $(git diff --staged)"

# Focus on performance only
codex exec "Review this diff ONLY for performance issues and algorithm complexity: $(git diff --staged)"
```

### Option 4: Compare with Auto-fix

```bash
# 1. Get review
codex exec "Review: $(git diff --staged)"

# 2. If issues found, ask Codex to fix
codex exec --mode auto-edit "Fix the SQL injection and add type hints in user.py"

# 3. Review again
codex exec "Review the fixed version: $(git diff --staged)"
```

## Integration with Git Hooks

### Pre-commit Hook (Optional)

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "üîç Running Codex code review..."

# Check if there are staged changes
if git diff --staged --quiet; then
    echo "No staged changes to review."
    exit 0
fi

# Run Codex review
REVIEW=$(codex exec "Quick review, score only: $(git diff --staged)")

# Extract score (basic parsing)
SCORE=$(echo "$REVIEW" | grep -oP 'OVERALL SCORE: \K\d+')

if [ -z "$SCORE" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not determine score, allowing commit"
    exit 0
fi

# Block commit if score < 70
if [ "$SCORE" -lt 70 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Code review failed (Score: $SCORE/100)"
    echo "Fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Code review passed (Score: $SCORE/100)"
exit 0
```

Make executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

1. **Always review before commit**
   - Make it a habit
   - Catch issues early
   - Improve code quality over time

2. **Trust but verify**
   - Codex is very good but not perfect
   - Review Codex's suggestions critically
   - Use your judgment

3. **Fix critical issues immediately**
   - Never commit with critical security issues
   - Address bugs before they reach production
   - Don't accumulate technical debt

4. **Track review history**
   - Keep `.code-reviews/` in git
   - Learn from past issues
   - Measure quality trends

5. **Use specific prompts**
   - Ask for detailed explanations when needed
   - Focus on specific aspects (security, performance)
   - Request code examples for fixes

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Don't skip reviews for "small" changes**
   - Small changes can have big bugs
   - Security issues don't discriminate by LOC
   - Build the habit

2. **Don't ignore warnings**
   - Today's warning = tomorrow's bug
   - Code quality compounds
   - Fix early, fix often

3. **Don't commit on red**
   - If recommendation is "needs_work", don't commit
   - If critical issues exist, fix first
   - Never compromise on security

4. **Don't review huge diffs**
   - Break large changes into smaller commits
   - Review file-by-file if needed
   - Large diffs = missed issues

5. **Don't disable the skill**
   - Consistency is key
   - Quality requires discipline
   - Make it non-negotiable
