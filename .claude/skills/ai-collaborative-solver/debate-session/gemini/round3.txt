Okay, I will synthesize the Explorer's ideas and the Critic's feedback to identify the most promising and feasible approaches for improving Django performance.

1. **Your Perspective:** As the Solution Synthesizer, I will focus on creating a practical plan that addresses the performance bottleneck within the given constraints: a week-long deadline, no DBA, a large dataset, and a team with intermediate Django ORM skills. The plan will prioritize profiling to identify the bottleneck, followed by targeted optimizations that the team can realistically implement.

2. **Key Points:**
    *   Profiling is the crucial first step. Without it, any optimization is a shot in the dark.
    *   Caching should be considered, but with a simple, well-defined invalidation strategy.
    *   Query optimization using Django ORM tools and basic indexing is the most feasible approach.
    *   Horizontal scaling is not a viable option given the constraints.

3.  **Evidence/Reasoning:**
    *   **Profiling Importance:** The Critic rightly points out the need for profiling [T2]. Django Debug Toolbar is a good starting point to identify slow queries and database access patterns.
    *   **Cautious Caching:** Caching can provide significant performance improvements, but the invalidation strategy must be simple and reliable given the lack of DBA support [T1]. A time-based cache invalidation might be appropriate initially.
    *   **ORM Optimization:** The team's existing Django ORM skills should be leveraged. `select_related` and `prefetch_related` can be used to reduce the number of database queries. Simple indexing on frequently queried fields can also help [T1]. More complex query optimization techniques should be avoided initially.
    *   **Scaling Infeasibility:** Horizontal scaling is too complex to implement within the given timeframe and resource constraints [T3].

4.  **Questions/Concerns:**
    *   What are the most frequently accessed tables and fields?
    *   What is the read/write ratio for the database?
    *   What is the current cache configuration (if any)?
