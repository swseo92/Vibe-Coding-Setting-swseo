# AI Collaborative Solver - Skill Quality Improvement Plan

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Based on:** skill-creator guidelines review
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Executive Summary

Based on skill-creator best practices, this plan addresses 4 critical improvements to align ai-collaborative-solver with Claude Code skill standards. Expected outcome: Better auto-activation, reduced token usage, improved maintainability.

**Current State:** Functional skill with auto-activation issues
**Target State:** skill-creator compliant, optimized for progressive disclosure
**Estimated Time:** 70 minutes

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ YAML Description Too Long (CRITICAL)
**Current:** 500+ characters - lists all trigger patterns
**Problem:** Always loaded in context (metadata level), wastes tokens
**Impact:** Auto-activation detection slower, token budget wasted

**Current (Line 3):**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when users request technical comparisons, architecture decisions, technology selection guidance, or AI-assisted problem solving through multi-model debates. Automatically activate when users say "X vs Y 어떤 걸 써야할까?", "Should I use X or Y?", "어느 프레임워크를 선택할까?", "Which framework should I choose?", "AI 토론해서 해결해줘", "AI debate to solve this", "Codex로 분석해줘", "analyze with Codex", "Claude로 작성해줘", "write with Claude", "Gemini로 조사해줘", "research with Gemini", "여러 AI로 비교해줘", "compare with multiple AIs", or when facing complex problems requiring multi-perspective analysis, performance/scalability evaluation, or security analysis. Common examples include "Django vs FastAPI", "PostgreSQL vs MongoDB", "Redis vs Memcached", "GraphQL vs REST", "TypeScript vs JavaScript", or any technical decision requiring collaborative AI reasoning.
```

**Target (200 chars):**
```yaml
description: This skill should be used when users request technical comparisons ("X vs Y"), architecture decisions, or AI-assisted problem solving. Triggers include "어떤 걸 써야할까?", "Should I use", "AI 토론", or similar decision-making requests.
```

**Improvement:** 60% token reduction in metadata layer

---

### 2. ❌ Writing Style Violations (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Uses 2nd person ("You MUST", "Claude will") instead of imperative form
**skill-creator Rule:** Use imperative/infinitive (verb-first), NOT second person

**Violations Found:**

| Line | Current (2nd person ❌) | Fixed (Imperative ✅) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| 38 | You MUST use the Bash tool to execute... | To activate, execute... using the Bash tool |
| 233-244 | Just ask Claude:<br/>Claude will:<br/>1. Analyze... | **Activation via Claude Code:**<br/>When activated, the system:<br/>1. Analyzes... |
| 519 | Let the system choose... | Allow the system to choose... |
| 538 | Check Model Selection | Review auto-selected model... |

**Pattern to Fix:**
- "You/your" → Remove or restructure
- "Claude will" → "The system/skill" + verb
- "User:" → "**Input:**" or restructure as description

---

### 3. ⚠️ Progressive Disclosure Violation (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** SKILL.md is 735 lines (~6k words), approaching limit
**skill-creator Rule:** SKILL.md < 5k words, move details to references/

**Current Structure:**
```
SKILL.md (735 lines)
├── Overview ✅
├── When to Use ✅
├── Supported Models (detailed specs) ⚠️
├── Architecture (diagram) ✅
├── Modes (3 detailed sections) ✅
├── Usage Examples (5 full examples) ⚠️
├── Auto-Selection Rules (13-row table) ⚠️
├── Model Comparison (detailed table) ⚠️
├── Examples (125 lines!) ❌
├── Advanced Usage (custom config) ❌
├── Registry Config (YAML examples) ❌
├── Best Practices ✅
├── Troubleshooting (73 lines!) ❌
├── Integration Notes ✅
├── Comparison Table ⚠️
└── Quick Reference ✅
```

**Sections to Move:**

| Current Location (SKILL.md) | Move To | Rationale |
|------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Lines 297-421 (Examples: 5 detailed) | `references/examples.md` | Keep 1-2 basic examples, move rest |
| Lines 562-634 (Troubleshooting) | `references/troubleshooting.md` | Error resolution is reference material |
| Lines 443-467 (Registry Config) | `references/registry-config.md` | Advanced customization |
| Lines 424-441 (Advanced Usage) | `references/advanced-usage.md` | Optional advanced features |
| Lines 273-291 (Model Comparison) | `references/model-comparison.md` | Detailed specs, load as needed |

**Expected Reduction:** 735 → 400-450 lines (40% reduction)

---

### 4. 🔄 Content Duplication (MEDIUM)
**Problem:** Trigger patterns listed in both description AND "When to Use" section
**skill-creator Rule:** "Avoid duplication: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both"

**Duplication Found:**
- **YAML description (Line 3):** Lists trigger keywords
- **"When to Use This Skill" (Lines 22-35):** Re-lists same trigger keywords

**Solution:**
- **Description:** Keep only core triggers (concise)
- **"When to Use":** Focus on USE CASES (not trigger keywords)

**Current "When to Use" (Lines 22-35):**
```markdown
**Automatically activate when users request:**
- Technical comparisons: "X vs Y 어떤 걸 써야할까?" / "Should I use X or Y?"
- Architecture decisions: "Django vs FastAPI", "PostgreSQL vs MongoDB"
- Technology selection: "어느 프레임워크를 선택할까?" / "Which framework should I choose?"
- "AI 토론해서 해결해줘" / "AI debate to solve this"
- "Codex로 분석해줘" / "analyze with Codex"
...
```

**Improved "When to Use":**
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

This skill is designed for:

- **Technical Stack Decisions:** Choosing between frameworks, databases, architectures, or tools
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluating scalability, optimization strategies, caching approaches
- **Security Evaluation:** Assessing security trade-offs, compliance requirements
- **Multi-Perspective Problems:** Complex decisions requiring diverse AI reasoning

**Common Scenarios:**
- Technology selection (language, framework, database)

**Priority:** High impact, low effort

#### Task 1.1: YAML Description Simplification
- **File:** SKILL.md Line 3
- **Action:** Replace 500-char description with 200-char version
- **Test:** Verify frontmatter syntax with `---` delimiters intact

#### Task 1.2: Critical Writing Style Fixes
- **File:** SKILL.md Lines 38, 233-244
- **Action:** Convert "You MUST" and "Claude will" to imperative form
- **Test:** Read through fixed sections for clarity

**Milestone 1:** ✅ Metadata optimized, critical style fixed

---

### Phase 2: Writing Style Cleanup (20 minutes)
**Priority:** Consistency

#### Task 2.1: Scan for 2nd Person
- **Method:** Search for: "you", "your", "You", "Your"
- **Action:** Convert to imperative or remove

#### Task 2.2: Scan for Agent References
- **Method:** Search for: "Claude will", "system will"
- **Action:** Convert to: "the skill", "when activated"

#### Task 2.3: Review Examples Section
- **Lines:** 297-421
- **Action:** Ensure examples use "Input:" not "User:"

**Milestone 2:** ✅ Consistent imperative style throughout

---

### Phase 3: "When to Use" Rewrite (10 minutes)
**Priority:** Remove duplication

#### Task 3.1: Rewrite Section Focus
- **File:** SKILL.md Lines 22-40
- **Action:** Replace trigger keywords with use case descriptions
- **Reference:** Use plan template above

#### Task 3.2: Verify No Overlap
- **Check:** YAML description ≠ "When to Use" content
- **Ensure:** Description = triggers, "When to Use" = scenarios

**Milestone 3:** ✅ No duplication, clear use cases

---

### Phase 4: Progressive Disclosure (30 minutes)
**Priority:** Token efficiency

#### Task 4.1: Create Reference Files
```bash
cd .claude/skills/ai-collaborative-solver/references/
touch examples.md
touch troubleshooting.md
touch advanced-usage.md
touch registry-config.md
touch model-comparison.md
```

#### Task 4.2: Move Examples
- **Source:** SKILL.md Lines 297-421
- **Dest:** `references/examples.md`
- **Keep in SKILL.md:** Example 1 (basic) + Example 5 (Claude Code)
- **Move:** Examples 2, 3, 4

#### Task 4.3: Move Troubleshooting
- **Source:** SKILL.md Lines 562-634
- **Dest:** `references/troubleshooting.md`
- **Add to SKILL.md:** "For troubleshooting, see `references/troubleshooting.md`"

#### Task 4.4: Move Advanced Content
- **Registry Config (Lines 443-467)** → `references/registry-config.md`
- **Advanced Usage (Lines 424-441)** → `references/advanced-usage.md`
- **Model Comparison (Lines 273-291)** → `references/model-comparison.md`

#### Task 4.5: Update SKILL.md References
Add to end of relevant sections:
```markdown
**For detailed examples, see:** `references/examples.md`
**For troubleshooting, see:** `references/troubleshooting.md`
**For advanced configuration, see:** `references/advanced-usage.md`, `references/registry-config.md`
**For model comparison details, see:** `references/model-comparison.md`
```

**Milestone 4:** ✅ SKILL.md reduced to 400-450 lines, references structured

---

### Phase 5: Verification (5 minutes)
**Priority:** Quality assurance

#### Task 5.1: Checklist
- [ ] YAML frontmatter valid (name, description present)
- [ ] Description < 250 chars
- [ ] No "you/your" in SKILL.md
- [ ] No "Claude will" patterns
- [ ] "When to Use" focuses on scenarios, not triggers
- [ ] SKILL.md < 500 lines
- [ ] All references/ files created and linked

#### Task 5.2: Test Auto-Activation
```bash
# Test in Claude Code (requires /apply-settings first)
# User message: "FastAPI vs Flask 어떤 걸 써야할까?"
# Expected: Skill auto-activates
```

**Milestone 5:** ✅ All quality checks passed

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Description Length | 500 chars | 200 chars | <250 chars |
| SKILL.md Lines | 735 | 400-450 | <500 |
| 2nd Person Violations | 8+ | 0 | 0 |
| Imperative Style | Partial | 100% | 100% |
| Content Duplication | Yes | No | No |
| Token Usage (Metadata) | ~600 | ~250 | <300 |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Auto-Activation Breaks
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High
**Mitigation:** Test with multiple trigger patterns after YAML change

### Risk 2: Content Loss During Move
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
1. Git commit before changes
2. Verify all moved content appears in references/
3. Test links to reference files

### Risk 3: Writing Style Over-Correction
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:** Keep user-facing examples conversational (Input/Output blocks)

---

## Rollback Plan

If auto-activation fails after changes:

1. **Immediate:** Revert YAML description to previous version
2. **Diagnose:** Compare trigger patterns in old vs new description
3. **Fix:** Add missing trigger keywords back to description
4. **Test:** Verify auto-activation works
5. **Iterate:** Gradually simplify description while monitoring activation

---

## Post-Implementation

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update USAGE.md with new references/ structure
- [ ] Add note to README about skill-creator compliance
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with improvement version

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding more `references/` content (playbook examples, mode configs)
- Evaluate splitting SKILL.md into "Quick Start" and "Full Documentation" versions
- Monitor token usage with new structure
