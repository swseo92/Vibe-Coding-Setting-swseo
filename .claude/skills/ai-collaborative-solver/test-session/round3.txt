1. **Your Perspective**: The core issue is the mismatch between the problem's simplicity and the solution's complexity. We need to extract generalizable lessons about problem-solving approach selection.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Simplicity First: For basic problems, the simplest solution is usually best.
   - Method Selection: The optimal method depends on problem constraints (e.g., required precision, scale, context).
   - Trade-offs: Different methods offer trade-offs between efficiency, scalability, and understandability.
   - Abstraction: Over-engineering simple problems can reveal useful abstractions for complex ones.
   - Learning Opportunity: Exploring diverse solutions enhances problem-solving flexibility.

3. **Evidence/Reasoning**:
   - Simplicity First: Direct calculation minimizes error and maximizes speed for simple arithmetic [T2].
   - Method Selection: Numerical analysis techniques are essential for complex equations but overkill for basic addition [T3].
   - Trade-offs: Programming offers scalability but introduces overhead compared to mental calculation [T2].
   - Abstraction: Representing numbers as sets is inefficient for calculation but fundamental to mathematical theory [T1].
   - Learning Opportunity: Understanding multiple approaches builds a more robust problem-solving toolkit [T3].

4. **Questions/Concerns**:
   - How can we frame the final round to emphasize the *strategic* choice of problem-solving methods?
   - Should we propose a rubric for evaluating the appropriateness of different approaches?
