Problem: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** PostgreSQL vs MongoDB: 어떤 데이터베이스를 선택해야 할까?

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

# Round 3 - Final Synthesis

## Analysis of Discussion

After reviewing the previous rounds, I notice we're having a circular conversation where each response reiterates the same PostgreSQL vs MongoDB tradeoffs without converging on actionable guidance. Let me break this pattern with a **decision framework** instead.

## Critical Gap Identified

**The problem statement is incomplete.** "어떤 데이터베이스를 선택해야 할까?" cannot be answered without context. Both previous responses correctly identified this but didn't provide a systematic resolution.

## Decision Framework (The Missing Piece)

### **Primary Decision Tree:**

```
START
├─ Do you have strict ACID requirements across multiple tables?
│  └─ YES → PostgreSQL (confidence: 95%)
│  
├─ Do you have undefined/evolving schema requirements?
│  └─ YES → MongoDB (confidence: 85%)
│  
├─ Do you need complex JOIN operations regularly?
│  └─ YES → PostgreSQL (confidence: 90%)
│  
├─ Do you need horizontal scaling from day one?
│  └─ YES → MongoDB (confidence: 80%)
│  
└─ Default case: Start with PostgreSQL (confidence: 70%)
```

### **Why This Framework Works:**

1. **Forces Context Gathering**: Each question requires specific project knowledge
2. **Prioritizes Critical Factors**: ACID and schema flexibility are make-or-break
3. **Provides Confidence Levels**: Acknowledges uncertainty
4. **Has a Default**: PostgreSQL as safe starting point (more mature ecosystem, JSONB for flexibility)

## Response to Other Models' Points

### **Agreement:**
- ✅ Both models correctly identified the need for context
- ✅ Hybrid approaches (PostgreSQL with JSONB) are valid
- ✅ Modern PostgreSQL has closed many gaps with NoSQL

### **Disagreement:**
- ❌ The repeated listing of pros/cons without a decision mechanism
- ❌ Treating this as a "debate" when it's really a **consulting problem**

### **What Was Missing:**
1. **Migration cost analysis**: Switching databases mid-project is extremely expensive
2. **Team expertise factor**: Learning curve can outweigh technical advantages
3. **Ecosystem maturity**: PostgreSQL has better tooling (pgAdmin, pg_dump, etc.)

## Final Recommendation

### **The Anti-Pattern to Avoid:**
> "It depends on your use case" (without follow-up)

### **The Better Approach:**
```
IF (no specific context provided):
   THEN recommend PostgreSQL with JSONB
   BECAUSE:
     - Lower risk (ACID guarantees)
     - Schema flexibility via JSONB
     - Easier to migrate TO MongoDB later than FROM MongoDB
     - Better hiring pool (SQL is universal)
```

### **Confidence Level: 75%**

**Why 75% and not higher?**
- Missing critical context (team size, budget, timeline)
- MongoDB is legitimately better for specific use cases (real-time analytics, time-series data at massive scale)
- Edge cases exist (e.g., multi-region writes favor MongoDB's replication)

## Practical Next Steps

If this were a real consultation, I would ask:

1. **"What breaks if your database goes down for 5 minutes?"** → Tests disaster recovery needs
2. **"Show me your 3 most complex queries"** → Reveals JOIN complexity
3. **"What's your data growth projection for 2 years?"** → Tests scaling assumptions
4. **"Who maintains this database?"** → Tests operational expertise

## Conclusion

**The real answer:** Use PostgreSQL unless you can clearly articulate why MongoDB's specific strengths (flexible schema, horizontal scaling, document model) are **essential** to your project.

**Changed from Round 1:** I've moved from listing tradeoffs to providing a **decision framework**. This is more useful than restating the same PostgreSQL/MongoDB comparison that both previous responses (and industry articles) already cover exhaustively.

**Confidence in this framework approach: 85%** (higher than my database recommendation because the framework is context-independent)
