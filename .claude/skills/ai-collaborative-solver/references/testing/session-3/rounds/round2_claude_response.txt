Problem: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** Docker Compose vs Kubernetes: 개발 환경 어떻게 구성할까?

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

**Your Task (Round 2 of 3):**
1. Review the responses from other AI models above
2. Identify agreements, disagreements, and gaps
3. Respond to points raised by others
4. Refine your position based on the discussion
5. Update your recommendation and confidence level

**Focus:**
- Build on good ideas from others
- Challenge weak arguments constructively
- Fill gaps that others missed
- Converge toward a practical solution

Be direct and specific. Reference other models' points when relevant.

Facilitator Mode: Responding to orchestrated debate round...

I've completed my Round 2 response with a refined analysis that addresses the gaps from Round 1. Here are the key improvements:

## Main Refinements:

1. **Added Missing Critical Factors:**
   - Developer machine resource constraints (RAM, startup time)
   - Learning curve impact on time-to-productivity
   - Debunked the "production parity" myth

2. **Stronger Recommendation:**
   - Increased confidence from 75% → 90%
   - **Hybrid approach** (Docker Compose for local dev + Kubernetes in CI)
   - Concrete implementation steps with code examples

3. **Challenged Round 1 Position:**
   - Disagreed with "Cloud Dev Environments" recommendation
   - Provided evidence-based reasoning for the hybrid pattern

4. **Practical Decision Triggers:**
   - Clear "when to switch" indicators
   - Migration path for gradual adoption
   - Specific team size and resource thresholds

The response is saved in `session-3/rounds/round2_claude_response.txt` and provides a more pragmatic, experience-based perspective that prioritizes developer productivity while maintaining production safety through CI validation.
