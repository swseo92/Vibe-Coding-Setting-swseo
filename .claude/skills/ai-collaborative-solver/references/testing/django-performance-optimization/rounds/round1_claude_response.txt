Problem: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** Django 기반 API 응답 속도가 느립니다. Redis 캐싱, 데이터베이스 인덱싱, 쿼리 최적화 중 어디부터 시작해야 할까요?

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

## Summary

**Problem:** Slow Django API - need optimization strategy  
**Recommendation:** Hybrid incremental approach (Query optimization → Indexing → Profiling → Redis if needed)  
**Confidence:** 75%  
**Key Insight:** Most Django performance issues stem from ORM misuse (N+1 queries) and missing indexes - fix these zero-cost issues before adding infrastructure

**Next round questions to refine:**
- What's the current average response time?
- Is the Django project using PostgreSQL or MySQL?
- Are there existing query optimization attempts?
- What's the read:write ratio?
