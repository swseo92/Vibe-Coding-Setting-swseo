Problem: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** 최종 테스트: FastAPI vs Flask 비교

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

## Summary

This initial analysis reveals that **FastAPI vs Flask is not a binary choice** but depends on:
- Project requirements (API-first vs full-stack)
- Team capabilities (async proficiency)
- Performance needs (concurrency levels)
- Timeline constraints (development speed)

**Key Insight:** FastAPI represents the modern Python web direction, but Flask remains valid for many scenarios. The decision should be driven by specific project context rather than trends.

**Next Round Focus Areas:**
1. Concrete performance benchmarks
2. Migration path complexity
3. Real-world production case studies
4. Cost-benefit analysis for specific scenarios
