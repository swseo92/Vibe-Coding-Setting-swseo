Problem: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** FastAPI vs Flask: 신규 API 프로젝트에 어떤 걸 선택해야 할까?

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.
