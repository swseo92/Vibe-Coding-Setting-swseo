Mock Response (initial):

Analysis of: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** Which database is better for a social media app?

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

**Your Task (Round 3 of 3):**
1. Review the responses from other AI models above
2. Identify agreements, disagreements, and gaps
3. Respond to points raised by others
4. Refine your position based on the discussion
5. Update your recommendation and confidence level

**Focus:**
- Build on good ideas from others
- Challenge weak arguments constructively
- Fill gaps that others missed
- Converge toward a practical solution

Be direct and specific. Reference other models' points when relevant.

**Updated Recommendation:**
Based on the multi-round discussion, I recommend proceeding with a balanced approach.

**Confidence:** 85% (+10% from last round due to convergence)
