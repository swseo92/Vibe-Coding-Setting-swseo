# Codex Collaborative Solver: V2.0 vs V3.0

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | V2.0 (Stable) | V3.0 (Experimental) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Status** | ✅ Production-ready | 🧪 Design complete, automation pending |
| **Philosophy** | Facilitate debates | **Ensure quality outcomes** |
| **Complexity** | Simple (8 phases) | Complex (3-layer facilitator) |
| **Adaptability** | Fixed process | **3 modes** (exploration/balanced/execution) |
| **Quality Control** | Manual | **Automated** (facilitator) |
| **Knowledge Reuse** | ❌ None | **✅ Playbooks** |
| **Failure Detection** | ❌ None | **✅ 10 mechanisms** |
| **Evidence System** | Implicit | **Tiered (T1/T2/T3)** |
| **Coverage** | Ad-hoc | **8-dimension monitor** |
| **Actionability** | 60% | **90% (expected)** |
| **Speed** | Fast (15-25 min) | Slower (20-30 min) |
| **Best For** | Quick decisions, low stakes | High-stakes, need quality assurance |

## When to Use Which?

### Use V2.0 if:
- ✅ Speed is priority
- ✅ Simple, straightforward problem
- ✅ Low stakes, experimental work
- ✅ Trust AI judgment
- ✅ Want minimal overhead

### Use V3.0 if:
- ✅ Quality is critical
- ✅ Production systems, high stakes
- ✅ Need systematic coverage (security, compliance, testing)
- ✅ Want to build knowledge (playbooks)
- ✅ Need explicit confidence levels
- ✅ Information uncertainty exists

## File Locations

**V2.0 (Current):**
- Location: `~/.claude/skills/codex-collaborative-solver/`
- Main doc: `skill.md`
- Scripts: Stateful session management
- Status: Production-ready

**V3.0 (Experimental):**
- Location: `.claude/skills/codex-collaborative-solver-v3/`
- Main doc: `skill.md`
- Comparison: `references/v2-vs-v3-comparison.md`
- Status: Design complete, needs automation

## Key Innovation in V3.0

**The Facilitator System** - Game changer that V2.0 lacks:

1. **Layer 1 (Rules)**: Coverage monitor, anti-patterns, scarcity detector
2. **Layer 2 (AI)**: Lightweight escalation for complex situations
3. **Layer 3 (Gate)**: Quality checklist before finalization

This is what transforms "debates" into "quality-assured outcomes."

## Migration Path

**Recommended:**
1. Keep using V2.0 for quick debates
2. Try V3.0 for important decisions
3. After 20-30 V3.0 debates, evaluate playbook library
4. Decide: full V3.0 adoption or hybrid approach
