# AI Collaborative Debate Report (V2.0)

**Generated:** 2025-11-02 23:39:09
**Model:** codex
**Mode:** balanced

## Problem Statement

Django 4.2 + PostgreSQL 14 API performance optimization: reduce response time from 2s to 500ms (75% improvement). Context: Django 4.2 with ORM, PostgreSQL 14, typical REST API with CRUD and some complex queries. Constraints: 1 week timeline, no DBA available (developer-level optimizations only), limited infrastructure changes. Goals: Achieve 75% response time reduction primarily through code-level optimizations. Current state: Suspected N+1 query issues, likely missing database indexes, no query optimization implemented yet, minimal caching. Typical scenarios: list endpoints with related data, aggregations, filtering.
