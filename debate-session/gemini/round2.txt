Okay, I will critically review the previous ideas, identify potential issues, risks, and feasibility concerns, and provide constructive feedback.

1. **Your Perspective:** Holistic Evaluation and Risk Assessment

2. **Key Points:**
   - The proposals lack a comparative risk assessment considering factors like data consistency, operational complexity, and vendor lock-in.
   - The "evidence" provided is generic; specific benchmarks and case studies relevant to the *application's* workload are needed.
   - The questions raised are good, but a framework for *prioritizing* them based on business impact is missing.
   - The proposals don't adequately address data migration complexities between different database types.

3. **Evidence/Reasoning:**
   - [T3] Industry standards emphasize risk assessment as a critical step in technology selection.
   - [T2] Case studies show that poorly planned database migrations can lead to significant data loss and application downtime.
   - [T1] Database documentation highlights the trade-offs between consistency models (ACID vs. eventual consistency).

4. **Questions/Concerns:**
   - What is the organization's risk tolerance for data inconsistency and potential downtime?
   - What are the specific data migration strategies for each proposed architecture?
   - How will the operational complexity of each solution impact the IT team's workload and skill requirements?
   - What are the exit strategies for each cloud-based solution to mitigate vendor lock-in?
