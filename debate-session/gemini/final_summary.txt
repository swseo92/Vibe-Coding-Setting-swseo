Here's a comprehensive executive summary of the debate:

**1. Recommended Solution:**

A hybrid database approach is recommended, leveraging PostgreSQL for transactional data requiring strong ACID properties and data integrity, and MongoDB for flexible, less critical data with high write loads and evolving schemas. This balances performance, scalability, and data consistency needs. A phased data migration strategy is crucial, starting with less critical data and thoroughly validating each stage to minimize risk.

**2. Key Rationale:**

*   Optimizes for diverse data types and workloads by using the best database for each [T3].
*   Provides horizontal scalability with MongoDB and strong data integrity with PostgreSQL.
*   Reduces risk through a phased data migration approach with thorough validation [T2].
*   Addresses operational complexity through automation and comprehensive training [T3].

**3. Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Application Profiling:** Profile the application's workload to identify performance bottlenecks and specific data requirements (read/write ratios, latency).
2.  **Data Classification:** Classify data based on consistency requirements, schema flexibility, and access patterns to determine optimal database placement.
3.  **Phased Migration:** Implement a phased data migration strategy, starting with less critical data, and thoroughly validate each stage.
4.  **Automation & Training:** Invest in automation tools and comprehensive training programs to manage the operational complexity of multiple database systems.

**4. Risks & Mitigations:**

*   **Data Inconsistency:** Implement robust data synchronization mechanisms between PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
*   **Migration Downtime:** Employ a phased migration approach with thorough validation and rollback plans.
*   **Operational Complexity:** Automate database management tasks and provide comprehensive training to the IT team.

**5. Confidence Level:**

85% - The hybrid approach is well-supported by industry best practices and case studies. However, the specific implementation details and application requirements will significantly impact the success of the solution.

**6. Evidence Quality:**

*   \[T3] Industry experts recommend hybrid database solutions.
*   \[T2] Case studies demonstrate phased data migrations reduce risk.
*   \[T3] Automation and training mitigate operational complexity.
