Mock Response (initial):

Analysis of: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** Redis Write-through vs Write-back

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

**Initial Assessment:**
- Point 1: This is a common problem in distributed systems
- Point 2: Multiple approaches are viable depending on constraints
- Point 3: Performance vs Complexity tradeoff is key

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Solution A: Fast but complex
2. Solution B: Simple but slower
3. Solution C: Balanced approach

**Initial Recommendation:**
I recommend starting with Solution C (balanced approach) to minimize risk.

**Confidence:** 75%
