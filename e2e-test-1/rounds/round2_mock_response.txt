Mock Response (with context):

After reviewing the previous discussion, I maintain my analysis:

**Refined Analysis:**
- Point 1: Building on previous insights
- Point 2: Addressing concerns raised by other models
- Point 3: New perspective on ## Context from Other Models:

### mock:

  Running mock adapter...
Mock Response (initial):

Analysis of: You are participating in a multi-model AI debate to solve this problem:

**Problem:** Django vs FastAPI 성능 비교

**Your Task (Round 1):**
1. Analyze the problem from your unique perspective
2. Generate 3-5 potential approaches or solutions
3. Highlight key considerations and tradeoffs
4. Provide initial recommendation with confidence level (0-100%)

**Mode:** simple
**Round:** 1 of 3

Be thorough but concise. This is the initial exploration phase.

**Initial Assessment:**
- Point 1: This is a common problem in distributed systems
- Point 2: Multiple approaches are viable depending on constraints
- Point 3: Performance vs Complexity tradeoff is key

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Solution A: Fast but complex
2. Solution B: Simple but slower
3. Solution C: Balanced approach

**Initial Recommendation:**
I recommend starting with Solution C (balanced approach) to minimize risk.

**Your Task (Round 2 of 3):**
1. Review the responses from other AI models above
2. Identify agreements, disagreements, and gaps
3. Respond to points raised by others
4. Refine your position based on the discussion
5. Update your recommendation and confidence level

**Focus:**
- Build on good ideas from others
- Challenge weak arguments constructively
- Fill gaps that others missed
- Converge toward a practical solution

Be direct and specific. Reference other models' points when relevant.

**Updated Recommendation:**
Based on the multi-round discussion, I recommend proceeding with a balanced approach.

**Confidence:** 85% (+10% from last round due to convergence)
